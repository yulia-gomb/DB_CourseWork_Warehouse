# DB_CourseWork_Warehouse
This database is designed for the storage and management of data related to the operations of warehouses that handle confectionery products. It encompasses information about the arrival of goods at these specialized storage facilities. The database includes two models: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

# Database Documentation and Script Execution
Detailed information about the database, including schemas, data models, functionalities, and maintenance procedures, can be found in the specified file. To proceed with the implementation and to understand how to operate the database scripts for both models, refer to the file "DB_Yuliya_Grasevich_CourseWork_descriptions from root level".

# OLTP Model
This model is structured to handle the day-to-day transactional data involving the receipt and management of confectionery goods in the warehouse. It ensures the efficiency and speed of routine tasks such as logging incoming shipments, updating inventory, and managing stock levels. The OLTP system is optimized for a large number of quick, daily transactions.

# OLAP Model
In contrast, the OLAP model is designed for analytical processing and enables advanced data analysis. This model supports complex queries required for data analysis, trend forecasting, and decision-making processes. It aggregates and analyzes historical data from transactions processed by the OLTP system. This helps in generating insightful business intelligence that can be used to improve operational efficiency and strategic planning.
